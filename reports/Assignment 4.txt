Assignment 4

Ques- Which future mode is  used in Fibonacci series and why?
Ans-  I have used Future Flag/mode as FUTURE_SHARED for implementation of Future_Fib. 
      The reason why I used this is because FUTURE_SHARED is immutable and will store 
      the previous values which is used in our fibonacci solution whereas in FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE 
      mode whatever is produced is consumed by the consumer and that value cannot be further 
      used and so will not work while solving Future_Fibb problem.
